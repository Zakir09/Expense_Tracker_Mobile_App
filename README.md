<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

This project was my first real dive into mobile development, and I learnt how to create a full app from the ground up. I launched Expense Tracker to see how we can help people, especially young professionals and students, take control of their finances as they start budgeting for the first time.

I used .NET MAUI to build it as a cross-platform app, which meant I got to learn a lot about how mobile apps work across Android, iOS, and even desktop environments. The process taught me about structuring an app using MVVM architecture, designing clean user interfaces, and thinking through how people actually interact with financial tools on a daily basis.

What started as a design idea turned into a real app with working screens, logic behind the buttons, and a simple, user-friendly layout. This project helped me grow my skills in both development and UX, and gave me a better appreciation of how much thought goes into making an app feel easy to use.

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

The Expense Tracker app includes a range of features designed to make managing personal finances simple, visual, and accessible:

- **Quick Transaction Logging**:<br>Users can easily add income and expenses with just a few taps. There’s also speech-to-text support, making it faster to record transactions on the go without needing to type.
- **Receipt Capture & Storage**:<br>Transactions can contain a picture of a receipt, which can be uploaded from the gallery or captured with the device's camera. This is useful for keeping records all in one place.
- **Custom Budget Setup**:<br>Users can create and adjust budgets that fit their personal financial goals. The budgeting tool is flexible, so it adapts as their financial situation changes.
- **Visual Insights**:<br>Financial data is shown through clear, easy-to-understand charts and graphs. These visuals help users quickly spot trends in their spending habits and track progress toward their goals.
- **Reminder System for Upcoming Payments**:<br>The app notifies users about upcoming bills or when they’re close to exceeding their set budget. This helps avoid late payments and encourages smarter money habits.
- **Accessible Design Choices**:<br>The app uses high-contrast colors, clean layouts, and intuitive navigation. It also includes features like speech input and thoughtful visual tagging (e.g., green for income, red for expenses) to support users with different needs.
- **Swipe Gestures for Editing and Navigation**:<br>Users can swipe on transactions to edit or delete them, or move between income and expense views. This keeps interactions fluid and modern.
